Infix to Postfix Converter and Evaluator with Custom Stack

Goal: develop C++ project to convert mathematical expressions from infix to postfix notation and evaluates them.

This project uses a custom stack implemented with linked lists, featuring overloaded operators for easy manipulation. The program reads expressions from a file, handles operator precedence, and outputs the postfix version along with the result. 

Key components include Node, Stack, and Data classes to manage the conversion and evaluation process.
